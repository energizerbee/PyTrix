**PyTrix**

My implementation of the matrix code rain animation.
RECOMMENDED YOU RUN IN LINUX OR UNIX TERMINAL (or bash on windows) IF NOT REPLACE os.system("clear") TO os.system("cls")
No other python libraries are required outside of default python libraries.
IDE TERMINAL DOES NOT WORK WELL AS OS FEATURES ARE RESTRICTED IN SOME IDE'S.

To run: 
In terminal navigate to the downloaded and extracted PyTrix file and run "python3 rain.py"
