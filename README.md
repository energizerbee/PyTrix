# PyTrix
My implementation of a terminal based matrix code rain generator, made from python, non-default python libraries not required.

Recommended that you run on linux or other unix distro (or change os.system("clear") to os.system("cls") if you are on windows.) 
IDE Terminals don't work well either since some os functions are disabled, I recommend that you run it in a raw terminal like bash.
